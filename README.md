# Bridge Simulation - Computer Graphics Project

This repository contains a simulation of a bridge implemented as part of a computer graphics project. The simulation demonstrates the use of graphical concepts and rendering techniques to visually represent a bridge.

---

## Features

- **Bridge Rendering**: Simulates a graphical representation of a bridge.
- **Educational Purpose**: Designed as a project to explore computer graphics concepts and rendering techniques.
- **Text-Based File**: Includes `bridge.txt` for additional details or configurations related to the simulation.

---

## Project Structure

```
├── bridge.txt     # Details or configurations for the bridge simulation
└── README.md      # Project documentation
```

---

## Requirements

- A compatible computer graphics environment or framework (e.g., OpenGL, WebGL, or a custom graphics library).
- Basic knowledge of rendering and graphical transformations.

---

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nehalms-Bridge_Simulation_Computer_Graphics.git
   cd nehalms-Bridge_Simulation_Computer_Graphics
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   Ensure you have the required graphics environment or library installed to run the simulation.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Graphics Framework/Library**: Suitable for rendering and transformations (e.g., OpenGL).
- **Text File Configuration**: `bridge.txt` for project-specific details.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add animations to the bridge simulation for dynamic effects.
- Include interactive controls to modify the bridge structure in real-time.
- Enhance the visuals with textures and lighting effects.
